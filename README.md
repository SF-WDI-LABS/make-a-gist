# Make a Gist!

As a way to review this week's materials, we're going to create some documentation that will be public on GitHub.

Write a Gist that could help a WDI developer entering the week that you just finished!

### Possible topics

- the term/concept that you identified as the most difficult from this week.
- Fails Guide: Tell the story of an error or bug that you encountered this week, how you debugged it, and what you learned from the experience.
- A concept that's poorly explained or confusing in the docs.

### Approaches

- gather the best resources on your chosen topic
- define all of the key terms related to the topic
- include code examples that demonstrate the syntax and technique around applying this concept
- provide the motivation for using this technique or understanding this topic
- make or find diagrams that might help somebody better visualize the concept
- create helpful analogies or metaphors

### Markdown Tips

- take screen shots using `cmd` + `ctrl` + `shift` + `4`. This command adds the screen capture to your clipboard (as if you `cmd`+ `c`'d it). If you paste into the textbox of any repo's issue editor, GitHub will give you markdown for that image to simply paste into your Gist!
- if you want to include formatted code, enclose the code with 3 ` marks at the beginning and end of the code block. After the "opening" set of 3 `, add the name of the language for language specific color scheme:
